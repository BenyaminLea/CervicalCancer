# Data sources

The primary data source of this project is Cervical cancer (Risk Factors) Data 
Set from UCI Machine Learning Repository. It gathered information including 
demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients at 
 the ‘Hospital Universitario de Caracas’ in Caracas, Venezuela. And the data is 
donated on 2017-03-03. 

There are 36 features in the data set, including non-disease behaviors, like 
smoking, and diseases conditions, like HIV, HPV. There are 4 target variables 
among the 36, which determines whether the patient has cervical cancer.

The issue with this dataset is that several patients decided not to answer some 
of the questions because of privacy concerns, hence missing values are contained.
