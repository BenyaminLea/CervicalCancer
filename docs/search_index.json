Some types of cancers are only feminine, because linked to the female body such as the gynecologic cancer. Gynecologic cancer is any cancer that starts in a woman’s reproductive organs. Cancer is always named for the part of the body where it starts. Gynecologic cancers begin in different places within a woman’s pelvis, which is the area below the stomach and in between the hip bones. Cervical cancer, ovarian cancer, uterine cancer, vaginal cancer and vulvar cancer are gynecologic cancers. Our study will focus on cervical cancer. Cervical cancer facts: All women are at risk for cervical cancer. It occurs most often in women over age 30 (CDC). At least half of sexually active people will have HPV at some point in their lives, but few women will get cervical cancer. Cervical cancer is less known than breast cancer but it is the 4th more important cancer for women. So, it would be helpful to learn risk factors of cervical cancer to prevent such disease. What is the age distribution of people diagnosed with cervical cancer? Is there any relation between age and cervical cancer? How do STD and other reported diseases or medical conditions relate to cervical cancer? What are the top 3 common diseases common with cervical cancer? How do non-disease behaviors, including sexual intercourse, smoking, hormonal contraceptives, IUD relate to cervical cancer? In the following chapters, we will discuss these questions.

It gathered information including demographic information, habits, and historic medical records of 858 patients at the ‘Hospital Universitario de Caracas’ in Caracas, Venezuela. And the data is donated on 2017-03-03. There are 36 features in the data set, including non-disease behaviors, like smoking, and diseases conditions, like HIV, HPV. There are 4 target variables among the 36, which determines whether the patient has cervical cancer. The issue with this dataset is that several patients decided not to answer some of the questions because of privacy concerns, hence missing values are contained.

The download contains one file only, risk_factors_cervical_cancer.csv. Since the file is in csv format, there is little we need to perform on transforming the data, as R can directly read the data from csv file in an efficient and accurate way. We would like to present some basic information on the data, including the variable names, variable types, data set shape, and basic observations on the data structure. 3.1 Variable Names and Variable Types ## Type Variable Name ## 1 int Age ## 2 int Number of sexual partners ## 3 int First sexual intercourse (age) ## 4 int Num of pregnancies ## 5 bool Smokes ## 6 float Smokes (years) ## 7 float Smokes (packs/year) ## 8 bool Hormonal Contraceptives ## 9 float Hormonal Contraceptives (years) ## 10 bool IUD ## 11 float IUD (years) ## 12 bool STDs ## 13 int STDs (number) ## 14 bool STDs:condylomatosis ## 15 bool STDs:cervical condylomatosis ## 16 bool STDs:vaginal condylomatosis ## 17 bool STDs:vulvo-perineal condylomatosis ## 18 bool STDs:syphilis ## 19 bool STDs:pelvic inflammatory disease ## 20 bool STDs:genital herpes ## 21 bool STDs:molluscum contagiosum ## 22 bool STDs:AIDS ## 23 bool STDs:HIV ## 24 bool STDs:Hepatitis B ## 25 bool STDs:HPV ## 26 int STDs: Number of diagnosis ## 27 int STDs: Time since first diagnosis ## 28 int STDs: Time since last diagnosis ## 29 bool Dx:Cancer ## 30 bool Dx:CIN ## 31 bool Dx:HPV ## 32 bool Dx ## 33 bool Hinselmann: target variable ## 34 bool Schiller: target variable ## 35 bool Cytology: target variable ## 36 bool Biopsy: target variable Dx: oncology tests on specific diseases. Test on genes and mutations. Hinselmann: a test method for cervical cancer by examining the cells on an instrument called colposcope. Schiller: a preliminary test for cancer of the uterine cervix in which the cervix is painted with an aqueous solution of iodine and potassium iodide. Cytology: A cytology test is used to look closely at cells and body fluids. Biopsy: removes a small amount of tissue to examine under a microscope. 3.2 Dataset Shape and Observations Row number: 858 Column number: 36 Observations: There are values ‘?’ in the dataset, indicating the missing of values. The patients may decided not to answer such specific questions that relates to the specific columns. That could be reasons of privacy concerns or personal misunderstandings. Smoke years, Hormonal Contraceptives years, and IUD years values are not integers but floats. This means when doing the survey, patients include months or days into the record. Specific down to months would make the data more specific and possibly help analysis on correlations between these year variables to cervical cancer to be more reliable. Some variables seem related by their properties. For example, when a patient do not smoke, her smoke years variable would be 0. When a patient did not have any number of diagnosis on STD, the Time since first diagnosis and Time since last diagnosis of STD variables are left to be ‘?’. This is a logical missing values in this circumstance.

Is this consistent for cervical cancer in this data set? 5.2 Number of Sexual Partners Does number of sexual partners relate with cervical cancer? How do the 4 different ways of disease diagnosis show differences? 5.3 First sexual intercourse (age) Does first sexual intercourse time correlate with cervical cancer? 5.4 Num of pregnancies Pregnancy and giving birth affects cervical tissue in many ways. Would number of pregnancy relate to cervical cancer chances? 5.5 Smoking Smoking is related to many diseases and is seen as one of the most common factors to severe diseases including lung cancer and hear diseases. Does smoking relates to Cervical Cancer as well? A mosaic plot between boolean variables smoking and biopsy results. Smoke years times Smoke packs per year to calculate total packs of cigarettes smoked. Investigate the relation with cervical cancer. 5.6 Hormonal Contraceptives Hormonal Contraceptives are birth control methods, considered as safe and reliable ways to prevent pregnancy for most people. Would Hormonal Contraceptives be a factor for cervical cancer? A mosaic plot between boolean variables Hormonal Contraceptives and biopsy results. We investigate further on number of years of using Hormonal Contraceptives and its relation with cervical cancer. 5.7 IUD An IUD is a tiny device that’s put into one’s uterus to prevent pregnancy. It’s long-term, reversible, and one of the most effective birth control methods. However, it is an extremely painful process and would make periods become heavier, more painful and longer. Question here would be if IUD relates with cervical cancer. A mosaic plot between boolean variables IUD and biopsy results. We investigate further on number of years of using IUD and its relation with cervical cancer. 5.8 STDs Sexually transmitted diseases (STDs), or sexually transmitted infections (STIs), are infections that are passed from one person to another through sexual contact. How does STDs relate to cervical cancer? Is it a possible factor? A mosaic plot between boolean variables STD and biopsy results. We then check if STD number correlates with cervical cancer. We would then look into a collection of different STDs and their correlation with cervical cancers. TODO!!!!!!!!!!
